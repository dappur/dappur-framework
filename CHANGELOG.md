# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Added `storage/certs/google` to `.gitignore`

### Fixed
- Contact Confirmation email
- Bug with pageConfig injection.

## [4.0.0-RC1] - 2019-07-14
## Notes
- I promise this will be the last major version upgrade for a while (I hope).  This was necessary in order to separate out the heavier dappurwares into their own repository so that they could be developed further.  The dapurwares that were moved into their own repositories are:
	- Deployment
	- Email
	- Oauth2
	- Video
- The email system has been revamped.  Plain text is now generated automatically right before sending.  This lightens the load on the email system considerably. 
- src has been fixed to pass all PHPMD and PHPCS-PSR2 checks.

### Added
- Google Analytics is now part of the admin dashboard using the Analytics Embed API and Javascript.  Setup instructions are on the dashboard page for all Admin roled users.
- Injected `pageSettings` into `$request->container->pageSettings` from middleware.
- Contact confirmation email to the page config for contact.
- Default `robots.txt` file to the `/public/` directory.
- Ability to delete settings individually from the dashboard.
- Webook controller for mailgun api.  This will auto update the email status within the dashboard.
- EmailStatus database table to track status changes of emails
- If admin, redirect to dashboard on oauth login

### Fixed
- General code formatting cleanup
- notFound and notAllowed handlers were not emailing correct data.
- Compensated for null values in the config
- Missing `templatesDelete()` function in `Admin\Emails` controller.
- Dashboard permission mispelled in menu setting
- Redirect on login
- PHPCS Fixes

### Changed
- Phinx `create-template.php` no contains the samples as part of the template code as I was constantly copying and pasting anyways.
- Cleaned up source code, removed unused functions and code
- All site errors are now reported to monolog
- Renamed theme files in the controller
- Moved the `/csrf` route out of middleware
- Updated `composer.json` for version 4.0 release that separates dappurware out. 
- Default database charset to `utf8mb4` and the default collation to `utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci`
- Plain text emails are now generated automatically from the HTML email.

### Removed
- Removed static use from all src in core framework.
- All references to plain text as that is now generated automatically using [soundasleep/html2text](https://github.com/soundasleep/html2text)
- Removed comments from database migrations

## [3.2.0] - 2018-12-03
## Notes

	- `/privacy` => `app\views\dappur\privacy.twig`
	- `/terms` => `app\views\dappur\terms.twig`
- Moved custom routes out of `public\index.php` and into `app\routes\custom.php`

## [3.1.2] - 2018-10-11
### Notes
- This updated required a small change for the menu display on the templates.
	- Please see [7dcf1f7](https://github.com/dappur/theme-dappur/commit/7dcf1f776b01415b32378509e352c6b12345e3e8) for changes to `dappur/inc/navbar.twig`
	- Please see [461d6fe](https://github.com/dappur/theme-AdminLTE/commit/461d6fe2b917a822d8fb7b0bdbfc3de2774b5d31) for changes to `AdminLTE/inc/admin-sidebar.twig`
	- Please see [2ea8d16](https://github.com/dappur/theme-AdminLTE/commit/2ea8d16c3fe28fc421a5679bcf9d90c8110cbc20) for changes to `AdminLTE/menus.twig`

## [3.1.1] - 2018-10-11

## [3.1.0] - 2018-09-16
### Notes

### Removed
- Both frontend and dashboard themes have been removed from the view folder. They have been moved to their own repositories.
	- [Dappur - Frontend Theme](https://github.com/dappur/theme-dappur)
	- [AdminLTE - Dashboard Theme](https://github.com/dappur/theme-AdminLTE)

### Changed
- Removed redundant `Controller.php` classes

## [3.0.3] - 2018-09-14
### Notes
This version includes support for Vagrant initially submitted by [dshimkoski](https://github.com/dshimkoski).  By using vagrant, you have instant access to a set up dev environment including:
- **Web Frontend:** http://localhost:8181
- **PhpmyAdmin:** http://localhost:8181/phpmyadmin
- **Raw Mysql:** localhost:8306
I couldn't get the `vagrant push` commands to work on my setup (Windows 10), but the goal of that would be to migrate and rollback the dev environment.  For now, those commands can be passed via `vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant && phinx migrate"` and `vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant && phinx rollback"`.  I have also changed the Vagrant `provision.sh` file so that you can re-run the provision script to migrate the database up.

### Changed
- Recaptcha is not configurable as on or off in the global settings.  Default is off.
- Changed mail settings for more generic smtp settings
- `token_secret` and `refresh_token` to text()
- `page_config` variable to `pageConfig`

### Fixed
- Cloudinary cloud name on seo settings and blog settings

## [3.0.2] - 2018-08-16
### Added
- Slim Session to global middleware

### Removed
- Removed `session_start()` and `session_set_cookie_params()` from `public/index.php`

## [3.0.1] - 2018-08-10
### Notes
In an effort to find some remaining bugs, I created a site using v3.  This update contains fixes for issues there were found during the process.  Import and Export has also been added to the custom routes and menus admin. 

### Added
- Mailgun api key and api base url to `settings.json`
- RouteName middleware to custom routes for active menu items
- Recent blog posts and recent blog comments as global twig variable
- Import/Export to Custom Pages and Menus
- Blog Sidebar and page header support to custom pages

### Fixed
- Image input on settings controls

- Redirect when adding a page config item
- Page config middleware was only pulling the first group when multiple were present.

### Removed
- Test function from controller

## [3.0.0] - 2018-08-08
### Notes
This is the next major version release of Dappur.  Dappurware has also been updated to version 3.0.0 so that the major version will match between the two packages.

With this version release, I think I am finally happy with the way everything looks and works.  I will continue to patch bugs and make other fixes but that will be the extent of the work on the core framework/template.  My goal when I began over a year and a half ago was to create a framework that contained all of the major features that most clients request and be able to deploy itself from a github branch using ssh.  I feel as though that requirement has been met.  I plan on using the extra time for:
- Writing proper documentation
- Clean up of the Dappurware codebase
- Finish the initial version of Dapp, a command line tool
- Unit Testing

Once those items are complete, focus will be shifted to feature enhancements.  The goal is to create an addon installer within Dapp that will automatically copy necessary routes and migrations, allowing a quick and simple command line install process.
- Universal shopping cart system with pre-built support for several payment providers including:
	- Authorize.net
	- Paypal
	- Stripe
	- If you have any suggestions, send me a DM or open an issue
- Notification System with integrated emails that can be triggered within the controller.
- More robust initial admin dashboard with stats and numbers

### Added
