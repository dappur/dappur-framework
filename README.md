### Pre-Requisites
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependency manager is required in order to use the Dappur PHP Framework.  Installation instructions are [located here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

[Phinx](https://phinx.org/) - Phinx is required in order to utilize the database migrations.  It is recommended that you install Phinx globally via composer by running:

    composer global require robmorgan/phinx

----------

### Quick Start Via Git/Vagrant
You can clone this repo and run `vagrant up` in the project root to provision a box that contains:

    - Ubuntu 18
    - PHP 7.2
    - Composer
    - Phinx
    - MariaDB 10.3

The script will also fetch dependencies, create a `dev` database, and run the initial migration for you.

----------

### Install Via Composer
You can start a new project user the Composer `create-project` command.

    composer create-project dappur/framework new_app


This will clone the Dappur Framework into a new project directory called `new_app`.   It will also automatically install and update all of the required dependencies.

----------

### Configure Project and Database
Configuring your new project is simple.  Rename `settings.dist.json` to `settings.json` and configure the following options at a minimum:
```
db->development->host
db->development->port
db->development->database
db->development->username
db->development->password
```
Once you have the `settings.json` file configured, all you have to do is navigate to your root project directory from a terminal and run the first migration:
```
phinx migrate
```

----------

### Run & Test Project
Once you have successfully done the initial migration, you can simply use PHP's built in web server to test your application by running the following from your root project directory:
```bash
php -S localhost:8181 -t public
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) to view your project.

----------

### Pre-Made Bootstrap Template
This framework comes with several pre-made Bootstrap pages to help get your project moving. All of these pages and their respective controllers/views provide you an insight into how the framework functions including form validation, CSRF, working with Eloquent ORM and other plugins.  You can expand on the default template or create a completely new template using Twig and the front-end framework of your choosing.

----------

### Admin Interface
In addition to the few basic front end templates, this framework also comes pre-built with a basic Bootstrap 3 admin dashboard. This dashboard can be accessed automatically by logging in with the admin user credentials.

**Default Admin Username:** `admin`  
**Default Admin Password:** `admin123`

It is HIGHLY recommended that you change the password immediately after your initial migration.
